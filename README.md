# Smart BMS - SoC Calculator 🔋

This is a simple Python GUI tool to calculate the **State of Charge (SoC)** for a Battery Management System based on input voltage.

## 👨‍💻 Developed by
Anto Abraham AJ

## 🚀 Features
- GUI built using Tkinter
- Real-time SoC calculation based on voltage
- Easy-to-use interface

## 💡 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter

## 📦 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the `.py` file.
2. Run the file using any Python IDE like Spyder or VS Code.
3. Enter a voltage and hit “Calculate SoC”.

## 📈 Future Scope
- Integrate real-time voltage from sensors
- Add graph of SoC over time
